    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Our project focuses on creating insightful visualizations based on the
      distribution and characteristics of stars in the Milky Way. By mapping stars 
      according to their brightness, temperature, and spatial position, we uncover 
      how stellar populations vary across the sky and better understand the structure 
      of our galactic environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern astronomical data has allowed us to grow our understanding of space and 
      the night sky by a tremendous amount. Research regarding the night sky was very 
      limited for a huge portion of human existence until recently. The vast amount of 
      complex astronomical data gives us flexibility with visualizations and insights, 
      revealing patterns that were previously hidden to humanity for millennia.

  <!-- Data Description Section -->
  <section id="data">
    <h2>Data Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Source:</strong> The dataset is derived from the HEASARC Bright Star Catalog 
      (Yale Bright Star Catalogue, 5th Edition), accessed through NASA's High Energy 
      Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center at 
      <a href="https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/bright-star-catalog" target="_blank" style="color: #63b3ed;">
        data.nasa.gov
      </a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Size & Scope:</strong> After cleaning and preprocessing, our dataset contains 
        3,100 bright stars with 64 features. The original catalog includes over 9,000 stars, 
        but we filtered to stars with valid parallax measurements (allowing distance calculations) 
        and complete positional data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Processing:</strong> We performed extensive cleaning including converting 
        sexagesimal coordinates to decimal degrees, filtering stars with parallax > 0, computing 
        3D Cartesian coordinates, creating brightness categories, and calculating distances in 
        parsecs and light-years.

      style="width: 100%; height: 640px; border: none; border-radius: 8px; "
    ></iframe>
    <p class="takeaway">
      This bar chart shows the distribution of stars across different spectral types, revealing 
      that most stars in the dataset belong to the cooler F, G, and K classes, while very hot O 
      and B type stars are comparatively rare. This pattern reflects the natural abundance of 
      stellar types in the observable universe, where massive, hot stars are short-lived and 
      therefore less common. The bar chart design is effective because it allows for direct comparison 
      between discrete spectral categories, making differences in frequency immediately clear. 
      The use of color reinforces the categorical nature of the data, and the interactive legend 
      allows users to isolate and highlight specific spectral types, improving focus and interpretability 
      without cluttering the visualization.

      ></iframe>
      <p class="takeaway">
        This scatter plot shows the relationship between a star’s color index 
        (B-V), which serves as a proxy for temperature, and its apparent brightness 
        (V magnitude). The visualization reveals that cooler, redder stars (higher B-V values) 
        tend to appear dimmer, while hotter, bluer stars (lower B-V values) are generally brighter, 
        reflecting a fundamental pattern in stellar astronomy. The scatter plot design is effective 
        because it clearly displays this continuous relationship between two quantitative variables, 
        while the use of transparency helps reduce overplotting in dense regions. Interactive tooltips 
        enhance the design by allowing users to explore individual stars in more detail without cluttering 
        the chart.

      ></iframe>
      <p class="takeaway">
        These density plots reveal the distribution patterns of stellar characteristics in our dataset, 
        providing a complementary perspective to individual data points. The temperature distribution 
        (top panel) shows that most stars cluster around B-V values of 0.5-1.0, corresponding to 
        yellow-orange stars similar to our Sun in the G and K spectral classes. The smooth curve 
        reveals a roughly normal distribution centered near the mean B-V of approximately 0.65, 
        indicating that intermediate-temperature stars dominate our sample. The brightness distribution 
        (bottom panel) demonstrates that most visible stars have magnitudes between 2 and 5, with a 
        peak around magnitude 3-4. The distribution shows fewer very bright stars (magnitude < 1) 
        and a gradual tail toward dimmer stars (magnitude > 6). This pattern reflects both physical 
        stellar demographics—intrinsically luminous stars are rarer—and observational selection effects, 
        as very faint stars are more difficult to catalog comprehensively. Unlike scatter plots that 
        show relationships between variables, these density plots emphasize frequency and concentration, 
        making it immediately clear which stellar types are most common. The mean lines (dashed) provide 
        reference points for typical values, helping contextualize individual stars seen in other 
        visualizations. Together, these distributions complement the scatter-based visualizations by 
        answering "how many?" rather than "how related?", revealing the underlying population structure 
        of bright stars in our galactic neighborhood.

      ></iframe>
      <p class="takeaway">
        This celestial sky map provides a geographic representation of stellar positions across 
        the night sky, using the astronomical coordinate system of Right Ascension (RA) and 
        Declination (Dec)—the celestial equivalents of longitude and latitude. The x-axis spans 
        0° to 360° of Right Ascension, while the y-axis covers -90° to +90° of Declination, from 
        the south celestial pole to the north celestial pole. The dashed line at Declination 0° marks 
        the celestial equator, dividing the northern and southern celestial hemispheres. The visualization 
        reveals non-uniform distribution patterns across the sky: certain regions show notably higher 
        stellar density while others are more sparse, potentially reflecting the structure of the Milky 
        Way galaxy itself. This map employs multi-channel visual encoding to convey three distinct stellar 
        attributes simultaneously: position (x,y coordinates) maps each star's actual location in the sky, 
        point size encodes apparent brightness with larger circles representing brighter stars, and color 
        represents stellar temperature derived from the B-V color index, with a gradient from blue (hot 
        stars exceeding 10,000K) through white (intermediate temperatures) to orange-red (cool stars below 
        4,000K). Interactive hover effects dramatically enhance exploration: when a user hovers over any 
        star, it enlarges to twice its normal size, brightens to full opacity, and gains a prominent golden 
        stroke, while a rich tooltip displays the star's name, exact celestial coordinates, magnitude and 
        brightness classification, spectral type, B-V color index, and distance in light-years. This 
        celestial map serves both as a scientific tool for analyzing stellar distributions and as an 
        engaging educational visualization connecting abstract data to the tangible experience of the night sky.

        This contour density map reveals concentration patterns in stellar distribution across the 
        celestial sphere using a fundamentally different analytical approach than individual point 
        plotting. While Visualization 4 displays each star as a separate point with interactive filtering, 
        this visualization employs density estimation and contour mapping to show WHERE stars concentrate 
        most heavily across Right Ascension and Declination coordinates. The contour technique aggregates 
        nearby stars into smooth density regions, similar to topographic elevation maps, where each contour 
        line represents areas of similar stellar concentration. The color scale from pale yellow (low density) 
        through orange to deep red (high density) creates an intuitive heat map visualization where "hot" 
        regions contain more stars. Multiple distinct high-density regions emerge as red zones, particularly 
        visible around RA 60-90° and RA 270-300°, with additional concentration near RA 180°. These dense 
        regions likely correspond to our view through the Milky Way's galactic plane and spiral arm structures, 
        where stellar populations naturally concentrate. Lower-density regions (pale yellow) appear at various 
        sky positions, potentially indicating areas where we're looking perpendicular to the galactic disk 
        or through less populated galactic regions. The celestial equator (blue dashed line at 0° declination) 
        provides spatial reference, and the density patterns show asymmetry across this line—suggesting the 
        galactic plane is tilted relative to Earth's equatorial coordinate system. Unlike scatter plots that 
        preserve individual star information (Vis2, Vis4) or frequency histograms showing attribute distributions 
        (Vis3), this density-based aggregation emphasizes spatial concentration patterns—answering "which sky 
        regions are most densely populated?" The smooth contours reduce visual noise from thousands of individual 
        points, making large-scale structural patterns immediately apparent without requiring interaction. This 
        non-interactive design ensures all viewers immediately perceive the density structure, whereas Vis4's 
        filtering requires active exploration. The technique complements our visualization suite by adding a 
        spatial aggregation perspective: while Vis4 shows individual stellar positions with multi-attribute 
        encoding (temperature, brightness, position), Vis5 reveals the overall density architecture of stellar 
        distribution, providing insight into galactic structure visible in our local stellar neighborhood.

  <!-- Interaction Section -->
  <section id="interaction">
    <h2>Interaction Design</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Interactive Tooltips:</strong> Multiple visualizations implement hover-activated tooltips 
      that reveal detailed star information without cluttering the display. In Visualization 2 (scatter plot), 
      hovering displays the star's name, B-V color index, and visual magnitude. In Visualization 4 (sky map), 
      tooltips show comprehensive data including celestial coordinates (RA/Dec), magnitude, B-V color, and 
      spectral type. This follows the information visualization principle of "overview first, details on demand"—users 
      can explore the overall pattern initially, then access specific information for individual stars as needed. 
      The tooltips appear near the cursor and update dynamically as users move across the visualization, maintaining 
      contextual awareness while providing precise measurements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. Highlight and Focus:</strong> Visualization 4 implements sophisticated focus+context interaction 
      where hovering over a star enlarges it to 1.8× its normal size, increases opacity to full brightness, and 
      adds a golden stroke, while simultaneously keeping surrounding stars visible for spatial context. This technique 
      enables users to identify and examine individual stars even in the densest regions of the sky map where hundreds 
      of points overlap. The enlargement is proportional and smooth, providing clear visual feedback about which 
      element is currently selected without disorienting the user or losing the overall spatial structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3. Interactive Filtering (Sky Map - Visualization 4):</strong> The celestial sky map features 
      comprehensive filtering capabilities that address the challenge of identifying trends in dense stellar 
      distributions. Users can click filter options in the right-side legend to isolate stellar subpopulations 
      by Temperature (Hot: B-V < 0.5, Medium: 0.5-1.2, Cool: B-V > 1.2) or Brightness (Bright: magnitude < 2, 
      Medium: 2-4, Dim: > 4). When a filter is activated, stars matching the criterion remain at 80% opacity 
      while non-matching stars dim to 10%, creating clear visual separation without completely removing context. 
      The selected filter option in the legend highlights to indicate active state, providing immediate feedback. 
      This filtering enables systematic exploration of spatial patterns—users can ask questions like "Where do 
      hot blue stars cluster?" or "How do the brightest stars distribute across the sky?" and immediately see 
      the answer through the filtered view. Multiple filters can be applied sequentially, and clicking "All" 
      resets to the unfiltered state. This interaction directly supports analytical tasks by making subpopulation 
      patterns visible that would be impossible to discern in the dense unfiltered display of 3,100 overlapping points.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>4. Legend-Based Category Selection (Visualization 1):</strong> The spectral type bar chart 
      includes an interactive legend where clicking on spectral classes (O, B, A, F, G, K, M) highlights or 
      isolates those categories in the visualization. This enables comparative analysis—users can focus on 
      specific stellar types to understand their frequency relative to others, or click multiple types to 
      compare subgroups. The legend items provide visual feedback on hover and selection state, making the 
      interaction mechanism clear and intuitive even for users unfamiliar with the dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>5. Trend Line Visualization:</strong> Visualization 4 (sky map) incorporates a cyan dashed linear 
      regression trend line showing the overall distribution pattern of stars across Right Ascension and Declination. 
      This statistical overlay helps users identify whether stars cluster along certain celestial coordinates—potentially 
      indicating the galactic plane—or show more uniform distribution. The trend line remains visible during filtering 
      operations, providing a consistent reference frame for comparing filtered subpopulations against the overall pattern. 
      The dashed style distinguishes it from data elements while maintaining visibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6. Non-Interactive Density Aggregation (Visualization 5):</strong> The stellar density contour map 
      intentionally lacks interactive controls, instead presenting an immediate, comprehensive view of concentration 
      patterns across the celestial sphere. This design choice ensures all users instantly perceive the density structure 
      without requiring active exploration. The smooth contour lines and color gradient (pale yellow to deep red) provide 
      pre-attentive visual processing—users can identify high-density regions within milliseconds of viewing. This complements 
      the interactive Visualization 4 by offering a different analytical mode: Vis4 enables detailed individual exploration, 
      while Vis5 provides instant big-picture density understanding. The static presentation also ensures consistent 
      interpretation across all viewers, making it ideal for presentations and reports where interaction isn't possible.

  <!-- Summary Section-->
  <section id="summary">
    <h2>Summary and Future Work</h2>
    <p>
      Our visualizations reveal that cooler spectral types (F, G, K) dominate the catalog, with 
      intermediate temperatures (B-V ≈ 0.62) and brightness (magnitude ≈ 5.06) being most common. 
      The celestial sky map with interactive filtering demonstrates non-uniform spatial distribution, 
      with different stellar types clustering in different sky regions. The density contour map (Vis5) 
      reveals distinct high-concentration zones at specific Right Ascension ranges (particularly RA 
      60-90° and 270-300°), likely corresponding to our view through the Milky Way's galactic plane 
      and spiral arm structures. These density patterns show that stellar distribution is highly 
      non-uniform across the celestial sphere, reflecting the three-dimensional structure of our galaxy 
      as projected onto the two-dimensional sky. Together, our five complementary visualizations provide 
      comprehensive analysis from categorical (Vis1), relational (Vis2), distributional (Vis3), 
      individual spatial (Vis4), and aggregated density (Vis5) perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Future work could include 3D spatial plots incorporating proper motion vectors, temporal animations 
      of stellar motion, integration with Gaia DR3 for precise parallaxes and radial velocities, correction 
      for observational selection effects to estimate true local stellar population demographics, and 
      constellation mapping to connect abstract coordinates with familiar sky patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Methodological Insights:</strong> This project demonstrates the importance of using multiple 
      visualization techniques to fully understand complex datasets. Each visualization type—bar charts for 
      categorical comparison, scatter plots for relationship analysis, density plots for frequency patterns, 
      point maps for individual spatial analysis, and contour maps for aggregated density—reveals different 
      aspects that would be invisible in any single view. The interactive filtering in Visualization 4 proved 
      essential for identifying subpopulation patterns in dense data, directly addressing the professor's feedback 
      about making trends visible. The combination of interactive exploration (Vis1, Vis2, Vis4) and static 
      presentation (Vis3, Vis5) serves different analytical needs—interaction enables hypothesis testing and 
      detailed investigation, while static views ensure all users immediately perceive key patterns. The careful 
      choice of visual encodings—position for spatial accuracy, color for categorical differentiation and temperature 
      gradients, size for magnitude, and contour intensity for density—demonstrates alignment between data attributes, 
      perceptual effectiveness, and analytical tasks. This multi-faceted approach transforms raw astronomical 
      measurements into accessible, interpretable insights about the structure and characteristics of bright stars 
      in our galactic neighborhood.
