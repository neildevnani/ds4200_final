    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Our project focuses on creating insightful visualizations based on the
      distribution and characteristics of stars in the Milky Way. By mapping stars 
      according to their brightness, temperature, and spatial position, we uncover 
      how stellar populations vary across the sky and better understand the structure 
      of our galactic environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern astronomical data has allowed us to grow our understanding of space and 
      the night sky by a tremendous amount. Research regarding the night sky was very 
      limited for a huge portion of human existence until recently. The vast amount of 
      complex astronomical data gives us flexibility with visualizations and insights, 
      revealing patterns that were previously hidden to humanity for millennia.

  <!-- Data Description Section -->
  <section id="data">
    <h2>Data Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Source:</strong> The dataset is derived from the HEASARC Bright Star Catalog 
      (Yale Bright Star Catalogue, 5th Edition), accessed through NASA's High Energy 
      Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center at 
      <a href="https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/bright-star-catalog" target="_blank" style="color: #63b3ed;">
        data.nasa.gov
      </a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Size & Scope:</strong> After cleaning and preprocessing, our dataset contains 
        3,100 bright stars with 64 features. The original catalog includes over 9,000 stars, 
        but we filtered to stars with valid parallax measurements (allowing distance calculations) 
        and complete positional data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Processing:</strong> We performed extensive cleaning including converting 
        sexagesimal coordinates to decimal degrees, filtering stars with parallax > 0, computing 
        3D Cartesian coordinates, creating brightness categories, and calculating distances in 
        parsecs and light-years.

      title="Star Spectral Distribution"
      style="width: 100%; height: 640px; border: none; border-radius: 8px; "
    ></iframe>
    <p class="takeaway">
      This bar chart shows the distribution of stars across different spectral types, revealing 
      that most stars in the dataset belong to the cooler F, G, and K classes, while very hot O 
      and B type stars are comparatively rare. This pattern reflects the natural abundance of 
      stellar types in the observable universe, where massive, hot stars are short-lived and 
      therefore less common. The bar chart design is effective because it allows for direct comparison 
      between discrete spectral categories, making differences in frequency immediately clear. 
      The use of color reinforces the categorical nature of the data, and the interactive legend 
      allows users to isolate and highlight specific spectral types, improving focus and interpretability 
      without cluttering the visualization.

        title="Color-Magnitude Scatter"
        style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none; border-radius: 8px;"
      ></iframe>
      <p class="takeaway">
        This scatter plot shows the relationship between a star’s color index 
        (B-V), which serves as a proxy for temperature, and its apparent brightness 
        (V magnitude). The visualization reveals that cooler, redder stars (higher B-V values) 
        tend to appear dimmer, while hotter, bluer stars (lower B-V values) are generally brighter, 
        reflecting a fundamental pattern in stellar astronomy. The scatter plot design is effective 
        because it clearly displays this continuous relationship between two quantitative variables, 
        while the use of transparency helps reduce overplotting in dense regions. Interactive tooltips 
        enhance the design by allowing users to explore individual stars in more detail without cluttering 
        the chart.

      <h3>Visualization 3 - Temperature & Brightness Distributions</h3>
      <iframe
        src="d3/4-density/index.html"
        title="Density Plots"
        style="width: 100%; height: 700px; border: none; border-radius: 8px;"
      ></iframe>
      <p class="takeaway">
        These density plots reveal the distribution patterns of stellar characteristics in our dataset, 
        providing a complementary perspective to individual data points. The temperature distribution 
        (top panel) shows that most stars cluster around B-V values of 0.5-1.0, corresponding to 
        yellow-orange stars similar to our Sun in the G and K spectral classes. The smooth curve 
        reveals a roughly normal distribution centered near the mean B-V of approximately 0.65, 
        indicating that intermediate-temperature stars dominate our sample. The brightness distribution 
        (bottom panel) demonstrates that most visible stars have magnitudes between 2 and 5, with a 
        peak around magnitude 3-4. The distribution shows fewer very bright stars (magnitude < 1) 
        and a gradual tail toward dimmer stars (magnitude > 6). This pattern reflects both physical 
        stellar demographics—intrinsically luminous stars are rarer—and observational selection effects, 
        as very faint stars are more difficult to catalog comprehensively. Unlike scatter plots that 
        show relationships between variables, these density plots emphasize frequency and concentration, 
        making it immediately clear which stellar types are most common. The mean lines (dashed) provide 
        reference points for typical values, helping contextualize individual stars seen in other 
        visualizations. Together, these distributions complement the scatter-based visualizations by 
        answering "how many?" rather than "how related?", revealing the underlying population structure 
        of bright stars in our galactic neighborhood.

      <h3>Visualization 4 - Interactive Celestial Sky Map</h3>
      <iframe
        src="d3/5-skymap/index.html"
        title="HR Diagram"
        style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none; border-radius: 8px;"
      ></iframe>
      <p class="takeaway">
        This celestial sky map provides a geographic representation of stellar positions across 
        the night sky, using the astronomical coordinate system of Right Ascension (RA) and 
        Declination (Dec)—the celestial equivalents of longitude and latitude. The x-axis spans 
        0° to 360° of Right Ascension, while the y-axis covers -90° to +90° of Declination, from 
        the south celestial pole to the north celestial pole. The dashed line at Declination 0° marks 
        the celestial equator, dividing the northern and southern celestial hemispheres. The visualization 
        reveals non-uniform distribution patterns across the sky: certain regions show notably higher 
        stellar density while others are more sparse, potentially reflecting the structure of the Milky 
        Way galaxy itself. This map employs multi-channel visual encoding to convey three distinct stellar 
        attributes simultaneously: position (x,y coordinates) maps each star's actual location in the sky, 
        point size encodes apparent brightness with larger circles representing brighter stars, and color 
        represents stellar temperature derived from the B-V color index, with a gradient from blue (hot 
        stars exceeding 10,000K) through white (intermediate temperatures) to orange-red (cool stars below 
        4,000K). Interactive hover effects dramatically enhance exploration: when a user hovers over any 
        star, it enlarges to twice its normal size, brightens to full opacity, and gains a prominent golden 
        stroke, while a rich tooltip displays the star's name, exact celestial coordinates, magnitude and 
        brightness classification, spectral type, B-V color index, and distance in light-years. This 
        celestial map serves both as a scientific tool for analyzing stellar distributions and as an 
        engaging educational visualization connecting abstract data to the tangible experience of the night sky.

    <h2>Interaction Design</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Interactive Tooltips:</strong> Hovering reveals detailed star information 
      including names, measurements, and classifications. This keeps visualizations uncluttered 
      while enabling deep exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. Highlight and Focus:</strong> Hovering enlarges and brightens selected stars 
      while dimming others, creating clear focus in dense regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3. Interactive Filtering:</strong> Clicking legend items filters displays to 
      specific categories, enabling comparative analysis of stellar populations.

  <!-- Summary Section-->
  <section id="summary">
    <h2>Summary and Future Work</h2>
    <p>
      Our visualizations reveal that cooler spectral types dominate, the HR diagram confirms 
      expected temperature-luminosity relationships, and many bright stars are extremely 
      distant yet intrinsically luminous. Future work could include 3D spatial plots, temporal 
      animations of stellar motion, integration with Gaia DR3 for precise distances, and 
      constellation mapping.
